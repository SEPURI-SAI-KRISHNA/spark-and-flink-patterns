# Spark and Flink Patterns

Production-grade patterns for building reliable, scalable, and fault-tolerant data pipelines using Apache Spark and Apache Flink.

This repository focuses on **recurring problems** encountered in real systems and **battle-tested solutions**, including their trade-offs.

## Topics
- Exactly-once semantics
- Late data handling
- Idempotent writes
- State management & TTL
- Backpressure & checkpoints
- Skew mitigation

## Structure
Each pattern contains:
- Problem statement
- Solution approach
- Pseudo-code
- Trade-offs & failure cases

This repo intentionally avoids full runnable code in favor of **design clarity**.
